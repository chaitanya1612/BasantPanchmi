        <p id="para"><bold><u><i>Basant Panchmi</i></u>, which is also known as 
            <u>Saraswati Puja</u>, 
            is a Hindu festival that is celebrated to worship 
            <u>Goddess Saraswati</u>. 
            This year Basant Panchami will be celebrated on Saturday, February 5.
            <u>Goddess Saraswati</u>
             is the one who gives us wisdom. 
            The festival is celebrated on the fifth day of the month of 'Magh',
            which is the onset of the spring season.
            
            <p>
            Basant Panchami also announces the arrival of 'Holi' 
            which takes place forty days later. 
            The Vasant Utsava on Panchami is celebrated forty days before Spring, 
            because any season's transition period is 40 days, and after that, 
            the season comes into full bloom.

            Basant Panchami is also when spring begins in India and the mustard flowers bloom. The color yellow is associated with the festival, and entire fields of mustard flowers resemble beds of yellow flowers when in full bloom. People wear yellow-colored clothes and also eat food that has the color yellow in it (like khichdi).

            Although the entire day is considered as being auspicious, the right time for doing the puja is in the afternoon.
